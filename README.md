# Bangalore House Price Predictor

Small Flask app to predict house prices in Bangalore using a pre-trained Ridge regression model.

## Project structure

- `app.py` - Flask application that serves the UI and exposes `/predict` POST endpoint.
- `templates/index.html` - Frontend HTML (Bootstrap) with a form to submit `location`, `bhk`, `bath`, and `total_sqft`.
- `RidgeModel.pkl` - Serialized scikit-learn model used by the app (required for predictions).
- `Cleaned_data.csv` - Dataset used to train the model (used to extract available `location` values).
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies.

## Dependencies

Install dependencies (preferably inside a virtual environment):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run locally

1. Ensure `RidgeModel.pkl` and `Cleaned_data.csv` are present in the project root.
2. Start the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open a browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and use the form to predict prices.

## API

- POST `/predict` — accepts form data `location`, `bhk`, `bath`, `total_sqft` and returns the predicted price (in Lakhs) or an error message.

## Notes & Troubleshooting

- If the UI doesn't populate locations, ensure `Cleaned_data.csv` exists and contains a `location` column.
- If predictions return errors, make sure `RidgeModel.pkl` is a compatible scikit-learn model and was saved with the same feature ordering that `app.py` expects (`location`, `total_sqft`, `bath`, `bhk`).
- For production, consider using a WSGI server (e.g. `gunicorn`) and configure proper environment variables.

## What I changed (UI updates)

- Grouped form fields into clear sections and applied a teal–indigo accent color.
- Replaced the background image with a modern home photo.
- Updated client-side JS to use `fetch` with improved error handling and visible result alerts.

If you'd like, I can:
- Run the app here and open the page for a quick live preview.
- Add a simple test or Dockerfile for reproducible runs.
